# lunch-repo

Inspired by Ashley Williams' great [breakfast-repo](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/breakfast-repo), this is a list of tech (mostly web) videos I found interesting, enlightening, insert other buzzwords. Stored here for your pleasure becuase I got sick of trying to remember them all. 

While I don't usually have enough time for a video during my coffee and breakfast, I try to squeeze one in during lunch to learn a thing or two, thus the name.
